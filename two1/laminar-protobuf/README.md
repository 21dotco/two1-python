## setup
1.  Use the protobuf directory here to set up protobuf on your system.
Do not download the Github one (This is a slightly modified version of protobuf to make it work with python 3). 
2. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/google/protobuf/) to setup protobuf binaries and instructions [here](https://github.com/google/protobuf/tree/master/python) to setup python specific bindings
3. Change the _laminar.proto_ to you liking. [Here](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3) is the reference for protobuf 3 which we use.
4. run ``./generate`` when you are done
5. Pick your language specific classes from the corresponding folder.
