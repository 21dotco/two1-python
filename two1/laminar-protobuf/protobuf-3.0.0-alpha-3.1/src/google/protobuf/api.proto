  // what to expect from different versions, and should be carefully
  // chosen based on the product plan.

  // API, which must end in `v<major-version>`, as in
  // `google.feature.v1`. For major versions 0 and 1, the suffix can
  // be omitted. Zero major versions must only be used for
  // experimental, none-GA apis.
