# The 21 BitRequests Library

## Overview

BitRequests wraps the python HTTP [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) library, adding a simple API for users to pay for resources. It enables a client (also referred to as a customer) to pay a server (also referred to as a merchant) for a resource.

The 402 payment-resource exchange adds an intermediary negotiation step between a standard HTTP request/response session. The following is how the transaction would occur for a `GET` request.


1. **GET /resource** - a client asks the server for some data resource (part of the standard HTTP request/response architecture).
2. **402 PAYMENT REQUIRED** - the server responds with HTTP status code [402](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html) to inform the client that the resource cannot be accessed without payment. The server includes headers to instruct payment.
3. **GET /resource (with proof of payment)** - the client repeats its initial request with a header that advises the server how payment is being made.
4. **200 OK** - the server responds to the client with the requested data (part of the standard HTTP request/response architecture).

Steps `1` and `4` are fairly well-understood in the world of REST APIs. Instead, this document focuses on the interaction that occurs between client and server in steps `2` and `3`, which is the core innovation of the HTTP 402 protocol.


## 402 PAYMENT REQUIRED

As of current, a merchant server's initial response will be `HTTP/1.0 402 PAYMENT REQUIRED` with the addition of a number of payment headers. This response informs the client how purchase should be made to retrieve the resource.

Each header and its related payment method is discussed in more detail in their respective sections within **Paid GET** below.

**Price** - the amount (in [satoshis](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_%28unit%29)) that is required to be paid for the resource

    Price: 3500

**Bitcoin-Address** - the bitcoin address where an `onchain` payment should be made

    Bitcoin-Address: 19tQ4iBbdhZsQKgZoeY3gVM1yyhGPxkiPM

**Username** - the server's username in an `offchain` payments network

    Username: HelloNakaMoto

**Bitcoin-Payment-Channel-Server** - the server URL where payment `channels` activity should occur

    Bitcoin-Payment-Channel-Server: http://example-merchant-server.com/payment


## Paid GET

In the client's new request, it needs to provide some indication that payment can or will be made. Let's take a look at how that works for the currently supported payment methods: `onchain`, `offchain`, and `channels`.

#### On-Chain Bitcoin Method

In this case, the server has recently sent a 402 response with headers to the client

    Price: 1000
    Bitcoin-Address: 19tQ4iBbdhZsQKgZoeY3gVM1yyhGPxkiPM

In order to provide proof of the payment, the client builds a signed transaction that pays to that address in the amount requested. The client then sends the raw, serialized transaction to the server in a header, along with a recommended return address

    Bitcoin-Transaction: 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
    Return-Wallet-Address: 1PUpAJXz8T6G7yTFW4rdvepKhcRcy8wwMg

#### Off-Chain Bit-Transfer Method

If a server responds with a `Username`, a client can make transactions on the 21 network, avoiding the need to wait for transaction confirmation on the blockchain.

    Price: 1000
    Username: HelloNakaMoto

In order to provide proof of the payment, the client builds and sends a bit-transfer token, which the server can use to redeem payment on the 21 network. The bit-transfer token is a serialized JSON object that contains keys for `payer`, `payee_username`, `amount`, `timestamp`, and `description`. The client then includes that token encoded as a UTF-8 string, and also includes a signed copy of the token using their machine wallet private key.

    Bitcoin-Transfer: {"payee_username": "HelloNakaMoto", "description": "http://example-merchant-server.com/resource", "payer": "Bitcoiner11", "amount": 1000, "payee_address": "19tQ4iBbdhZsQKgZoeY3gVM1yyhGPxkiPM", "timestamp": 1453338704.678601}
    Authorization: 1o8J+ECKu3TtLfbTYbCfSljwFnb3wup9/BUZk8NE2bp5jNPLrU9umbovWUqlEkPFx0ATQEvmvLa1H4dju2XXog==

#### Payment Channel Method

Conversely, if a server responds with a `Bitcoin-Payment-Channel-Server` header, a client can use that URI to negotiate an out-of-band payment channel.

    Price: 1000
    Bitcoin-Payment-Channel-Server: http://example-merchant-server.com/payment

The client then uses that payment channel server to open a channel and make a payment in the required amount. The client receives a payment transaction id that it can use to redeem the payment with the server at the original endpoint.

    Bitcoin-Payment-Channel-Token: f39d9402cef5292a14c9ba1722cb2c99fafe082505bd2d830b68beeb87b8237a


## Important Notes

#### Safety and Idempotence

You should notice that the examples so far have used `GET` as the primary HTTP method for interacting with a server. `GET` is safe insofar as it is being used for its intended purpose of information retrieval. In other words, repeated `GET` requests should result in the same response, without side-effects.

Requiring payment for a non-idempotent method like `POST` can be peculiar, and special care should be taken to ensure that side-effects do not ripple through your application.

For example, say a client wishes to "price out" your endpoint by sending a `POST` request with data such that they can receive a `402` response with the cost of the endpoint. Surprise! The endpoint was free, and their request (whether or intentionally or not) is processed.

#### Handling Errors

Traditionally, if a server encounters an error, due to its own fault or the fault of the client, it can simply respond with a standard `4xx` or `5xx` status code. In the case of a server who accepts payment, that server has the delicate task of handling errors ever so gracefully.

A client who sends payment, but does not provide adequate parameters to the API, should perhaps not be charged. That is, the server should validate parameters **prior** to accepting payment, else deal with a provided return address and reverse the payment.

There is certainly also the possibility that a server crashes for whatever reason, and does not honor its end of the 402 exchange by providing the requested service after accepting payment. Some method for recompensating the client should be put in place for these types of circumstances.


## BitRequests Class

### Definition

**BitRequests** is an abstract base class which provides much the client functionality of the 402 payment-resource exchange. It offers the following API:

**request()**

  1. Make the initial request
  2. Catch the 402 response
  3. Run the implemented `make_402_payment()` method, which returns proof of payment headers
  4. Repeat the initial request with payment headers appended
  5. Return the requested data

Convenience wrappers around `request()` to make a HTTP requests

 - **get()**
 - **post()**
 - **put()**
 - **delete()**
 - **head()**

**BitTransferRequests**, **OnChainRequests**, and **ChannelRequests** implement the `BitRequests` interface and define the primary payment function.

**make_402_payment()** - Contains all the logic for making a payment of the desired method. It should return headers that a merchant server can use to process payment.

**get_402_info()** - A function for returning only the 402 payment headers for a resource.

**init** - The class constructor should accept objects necessary to create payments. In the case of the three implementations listed above, the primary payment-creation object is a `two1.lib.Wallet` object.

### Usage

The API for using payment methods has aimed to be as consistent as possible. This should ideally allow users to seamlessly switch between payment methods without too much extra configuration.


    # BitTransferRequests
    from two1.commands.config import Config
    from two1.lib.wallet import Wallet
    from two1.lib.bitrequests import BitTransferRequests
    requests = BitTransferRequests(Wallet(), Config().username)
    requests.get('http://localhost:5000/my-test-endpoint').text

    # OnChainRequests
    from two1.lib.wallet import Wallet
    from two1.lib.bitrequests import OnChainRequests
    requests = OnChainRequests(Wallet())
    requests.get('http://localhost:5000/my-test-endpoint').text

    # ChannelRequests
    from two1.lib.wallet import Wallet
    from two1.lib.bitrequests import ChannelRequests
    requests = ChannelRequests(Wallet())
    requests.get('http://localhost:5000/my-test-endpoint').text
