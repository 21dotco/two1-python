# 21: Build the Machine-Payable Web [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/21dotco/two1-python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/21dotco/two1-python)

21 is an open source Python library and command line interface for
quickly building machine-payable web services. It allows you to
accomplish three major tasks:

  - Get bitcoin on any device
  - Add bitcoin micropayments to any Django or Flask app
  - Earn bitcoin on every HTTP request

The package includes:

 - an HD wallet to securely manage your bitcoin
 - crypto and bitcoin libraries to build bitcoin/blockchain applications
 - a [micropayment-channels](https://21.co/learn/intro-to-micropayment-channels/) client and server
 - commands for mining, buying, and earning bitcoin, as well as requesting it from the 21 faucet
 - tools for publishing machine-payable endpoints to the [21 Marketplace](https://21.co/mkt)
 - containers that allow your machine to sell machine resources for bitcoin

and much more.

## Security

_Please note that the 21 software is in beta_. To protect the security
of your systems while using 21, we highly recommend you install the
software on a device other than your main laptop (e.g. 21 Bitcoin
Computer, an old laptop, or an Amazon Virtual Machine) while the
product is still in beta. You can read more security-related
information [here](https://21.co/learn/security/). Please send an
email to [security@21.co](mailto://support@21.co) regarding any issue
concerning security.
