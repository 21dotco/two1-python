====

``two1`` (``21``) is a command line tool and library that allows users
to mine Bitcoin, use it to buy and sell API calls, set up world-readable
machine-payable endpoints, and publish them to the ``21.co`` marketplace
from any Unix command line.

Quickstart
----------

Installation!!
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python v3.4+ is required. To install the lib and CLI, run:

.. code:: bash

    pip3 install two1

*Note: you may want to install inside a ``virtualenv`` or your preferred
virtual environment*

Getting Started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At a bare minimum, any user should have a wallet set up:

.. code:: bash

    wallet create

A good next step is to set up a 21 user account at
https://21.co/signup/, and follow the steps to get started.
